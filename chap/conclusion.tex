\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we provide the SafeExit, an extension of Tor, which provides a protection for the exit node in Tor by finding the initiator of the Tor traffic that satisfies the audit condition.
SafeExit doesn't degrade the anonymity of the legal Tor users, as the SafeExit borrows the spirt of Tor to construct a chain of AORs to separate the user from the ACert.
Only when the exit node and all the AORs selected by the user cooperate,
 the user is linked with its activates which happens only in the audit.
In the situation except the audit, the probability of the cooperation is as negligible as all the selected ORs in Tor collude.
%Moreover, the traffic between the Tor that adopts the SafeExit extension and the standard Tor, is indistinguishable,
 %which allows SafeExit to blend its traffic in the Tor traffic  and be deployed gradually.
%All TEs in the SafeExit tunnel cooperatively generate  the evidence for the auditor to unmask the initiator of a Tor stream when necessary.
